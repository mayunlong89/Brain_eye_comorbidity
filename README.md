# ABSTRACT
Single-cell multimodal techniques have advanced the functional elucidation of disease-relevant loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). To explore the biological connections between the eye and brain, we integrated bulk and single-cell multiomic profiles with GWAS summary statistics for eight neuropsychiatric and five ocular diseases. Our analysis revealed five latent factors explaining 61.7% of genetic variances across the 13 eye and brain diseases, showing diverse correlational patterns among these conditions. We identified 45 pleiotropic loci with 91 candidate genes contributing to disease risk. Integration of the GWAS and single-cell data implicated excitatory neurons and microglia in eye-brain connections. Polygenic enrichment analysis identified 15 and 16 pleiotropic regulons in exhibitory neurons and microglia, respectively, linked to comorbidity. Exhibitory neuron-specific regulons were functionally involved in axon guidance and synaptic activity, while microglia-specific regulons related to immune response and cell activation. In sum, our findings reinforce the genetic link between psychiatric and ocular diseases.
