# ABSTRACT
## IMPORTANCE 
Comorbidities between eye-related diseases and brain-related disorders have been extensively reported, suggesting a biological basis for the eye-brain axis. Nevertheless, the overall genetic correlation and joint genetic architecture underlying diseases connected in the eye-brain axis remain largely unknown. 
## OBJECTIVE 
To investigate the shared genetic etiology between ocular diseases and psychiatric disorders and to uncover shared loci, genes, pathways, and cell types.
## DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS 
Our study utilized genome-wide association summary statistics, expression quantitative trait loci, and single-cell sequencing data from publicly available databases. Various statistical genetic methods were employed to sequentially unveil the pleiotropic loci with credible variants and genes, along with pathway-level, network-level, tissue-level, and cell type-level analyses, revealing the shared genetic etiology between five vision-threatening diseases (age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and myopia) and eight psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism specular disorder, major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome). Data were collected from October 20, 2022, to March 10, 2023, and analyses were conducted from April 15, 2023, through November 25, 2023.
## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES 
The primary outcomes included a set of pleiotropic loci, genes, pathways, and cell types contributing to shared genetic underpinnings between ocular diseases and psychiatric disorders.
## RESULTS 
We identified significant genetic correlations and substantial genetic overlaps between ocular diseases and psychiatric disorders. Modeling the joint genetic architecture of these 13 eye-brain phenotypes revealed that five latent factors, explaining 61.7% the genetic variances in these conditions, exhibited diverse correlational patterns. Cross-trait analyses identified 45 pleiotropic loci consisting of 91 genes associated with pairwise eye-brain diseases. The most highly pleiotropic locus (rs2282889), mapped to the transcription factor SP4, exhibited significantly concordant associations with 11 eye-brain diseases (m-value > 0.9). These shared genetic determinants demonstrated notable enrichments in metabolism pathways. Extensive phenotypic and cellular annotation unveiled a distinct divergence in the biology associated with eye-brain pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic genes. Notably, excitatory neurons and microglia displayed significant enrichments with eye-brain pleiotropic genes. 
## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE 
Our study highlights shared genetic components between ocular diseases and psychiatric disorders, and provides biological insights into the potential molecular mechanisms behind their comorbidity and implications for future therapeutic development.
